# RockPaperScissors_v0.1
This is my first ever program written: a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors to play vs an "AI". To track my progress of learning Python on my own newer versions will be uploaded every now and than, in which I will extend the game with new features, better code and so forth.

v 0.1 - first upload, basic game

v 0.2 - code cleanup
